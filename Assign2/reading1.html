                <h2>Q1: The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of the internet). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. Do they suggest solutions? If so, how do those solutions relate to the other article?</h2>
                <p class="bodyText">
                    These two articles were a really nice continuation of Ali Qadeer's lecture with the focus on the democratization of design and creativity in the tools we choose to use in our design practice.  Both articles make the reader think about how reliant tech users are on the "black box" of tools and platforms that we have no knowledge of and control over. In the case of the Eye magazine article, these tools are design software like Adobe CC, while in the Abbe article it's the internet in general. The articles both describe how we've adopted a very subservient, unquestioning attitude towards these tools, using them without considering how they guide and shape our work. In the case of design, this repetitive reliance and standardization of the tools we use to create our work can lead to monotony and a lack of original ideas being generated for commercial and other applications. The high cost barrier to using many of these standard tools also serves as a gatekeeper for entry into the field. Both articles suggest the need for tech users to reclaim their tools and become part of a democratization of tech. The Eye article promotes Open Source software as an alternative to Adobe, where designers create and share their tools, while the Abbe article suggests finding alternative internet service providers in favour of local, peer-to-peer networks.

                <h2>Q2: How do you see the impending resource scarcity discussed in Abbeâ€™s article having an effect yourself as a designer?</h2>
                     
                <p class="bodyText">
                    I think as designers who work daily on our computers, we often don't consider how much energy our work uses and how much we contribute to climate change.  Somehow computer usage seems detached from the more obvious forms of energy usage, like commuting to work in a car. It's concerning that we as designers have become so reliant on digital tools for our practice and I wonder if some sort of shift back to more analogue tools is inevitable as energy usage becomes more and more of an issue in the future.
