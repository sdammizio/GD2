                <h2>Q1: What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms?  </h2>
                <p class="bodyText">
                    Lialina's definition of the universal user is someone who is able to creatively get done what they want without prescribed tools/apps/steps. They are able to solve problems, fill gaps, improvise and extend existing systems to meet their needs. I definitely agree that in general, tech and software companies like to downplay the knowledge and ingenuity of the people who use their devices. In their eyes, the user is busy and needs a straightforward, highly prescribed way of using a tool so they can just get the job done and get back to what they actually want to do. If we think about tech users being universal users, then Schwulst's argument makes sense regarding the freedom and open-endedness of individual websites vs. platforms.  Individual websites allow the universal user to fully create a personalized space that meets their needs, as opposed to working within the boundaries of platforms. Platforms restrict how and what the user can do. For instance, designing a website with Adobe Portfolio or Format is much more restrictive than creating a personal website from scratch. Adobe Portfolio has a series of templates that the user can input information/images into, but the user has no ability to directly edit the code and customize the site. So, for instance, if the user wants to have images as buttons in the nav instead of text- that isn't possible. As a result, Adobe Portfolio sites will always look similar.

                <h2>Q2: What kind of computer user are you?</h2>
                     
                <p class="bodyText">
                    I think I am, unfortunately, much more of the "invisible" user Lialina describes. The invisible user is the person who is busy with something else and uses tech as a tool to accomplish that task. As stated by Alan Cooper: "As an interaction designer, it's best to imagine that users- especially beginners- are simultaneously very intelligent and very busy." Apart from this course, I'm usually using the standard apps/websites in the prescribed ways they were designed. In particular, I identified with the kind of user described by Adobe who uses CC tools as a way to efficiently get done what they need to get done- "I have more time to do what I like most- being creative".  I usually think of the tools as a means to an end, with less focus on the tool and the process.  My experience online is more of a treasure hunt- I'm looking for solutions to my problem in order to get to my end goal.
