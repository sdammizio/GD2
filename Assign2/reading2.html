                <h2>A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature. </h2>
                <p class="bodyText">
                    An example of programmatic patterning in nature is the unique shapes and variations of snowflakes. Snowflakes form when very cold water droplets freeze onto dust or pollen particles in the sky, creating ice crystals. As the crystals fall toward the ground, water vapor freezes onto the original crystal building a matrix of crystals that have 6 arms[1]. The programmatic part of this process is that there are parameters that will influence the ultimate shape of the snowflake- notably the temperature and humidity. As the crystal falls, it may begin to grow arms in one manner and then encounter a slight change in temperature and humidity, causing it to change the branches to go grow in new directions. As a result, no two snowflakes are the same because each individual snowflake follows a unique path to the ground.
                    Playing into this programmatic nature of snowflakes, as Van Rossum’s students did with typography in the Drawbot program (~18:30), scientists can grow snowflakes in lab conditions and experiment with temperature and humidity changes to catalog how artificial snowflakes grown under varying conditions[2]. Van Rossum discusses how he works to decipher the underlying logic or rules behind complex 2D pattern compositions so that he can render them in code and set them in motion (~1:00:00).  Likewise, scientists studying snowflakes have uncovered the basic rules to create a snowflake (water + temp+ humidity) and then can play with the numbers to produce different, unexpected results.
