                        <h2>Approach 1</h2>
                        <p class="bodyText">My first approach aimed to reflect my experience of COVID as a time in which I felt an
                            emptiness in terms of lost/missing experiences and relationships with friends and family.
                            I wanted to manipulate old photographs of people, textures and environments to create a
                            hazy, blurred collage.</p>
                        <p class="bodyText">I brought photos into the Pixlr online photo tool and used the photo filters to increase exposure and give a washed-out,
                            undefined quality to the photos. I also gave them a rounded corner cropping reminiscent of vintage photos to again give the
                            impression that these were old memories.</p>
                        <p class="bodyText">I then brought the photos in MS Word and used opacity and overlapping to create 2 different layouts. I also added some copyright-free
                                vintage icons that were tied to directionality, time and travel.</p>
                        <p class="bodyText">I brought the comps into Pixlr and Photomosh to further distort the images.</p>
                        <p class="bodyText">Using Pixlr, I added text, then rasterized it and used the eraser tool to erase segments of the letterforms to make the text difficult
                            to read. I wanted the text to look like there were parts missing, reflecting the concept of missing time/experiences.</p>

                        <h2>Approach 2</h2>
                        <p class="bodyText">With my second approach, I wanted to capture the feeling that COVID could sometimes feel
                            like a societal test/challenge involving jumping between different levels and completing
                            tasks (masking, vaccines) to defeat the virus. It sometimes felt like we were taking one
                            step forward and then two steps back. I thought using a pixelated videogame aesthetic
                            might convey this idea in an engaging way.</p>
                        <p class="bodyText">I started with research into old video game aesthetics, particularly Super Mario which so many of us played as children and
                            included symbols like “coins” and platforms that would be familiar/readable by an audience..</p>
                        <p class="bodyText">I used Pixlrart.com to draw out the illustration, including various platforms, masks and hand sanitizer and other COVID-related
                            symbols. I added “START GAME” to the bottom of the comp but later decided to change it to just “START” because I was concerned
                            I didn’t want to seem like I was trivializing the seriousness of COVID.</p>

                        <h2>Approach 3</h2>
                        <p class="bodyText">My final approach drew on the increasing reliance on screens and virtual platforms
                            I experienced during the COVID pandemic. I wanted to create a 3D portal connecting
                            different screens, which I thought I could do in Blender. I had used Blender in the past
                            for creating 3D rooms and animations, but I had never thought to use it for a traditional
                            graphic design medium like a poster.</p>
                        <p class="bodyText">I created a winding pipe in Blender, applied a shiny metalic material wrap and then sliced the pipe in half via a vertical plane. I
                            applied a cloud-like material wrap image to the vertical plane, then added further vertical planes at different intersections of the
                            pipe/background. I applied various Photomoshed screens (Google, Discord, Slack, Discord) to these smaller planes.</p>
                        <p class="bodyText">I added text in Pixlr, then rasterized it and erased sections so that the pipe looked like it was winding through the letterforms. I
                            chose the word “CONNECTIVE” to encompass the notion of connectivity through screens that was the focus of this comp. I chose
                            the version on the bottom right as my final submission for this project.</p>
