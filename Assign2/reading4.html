                <h2>Steyerl points to how aerial imagery and 3D-generated environments have altered the way we conceive of time and space. Because what we see now regularly incorporates views that can only be generated by machines, more specifically computers, she argues that we live in a society of “hyperreal representations—not of space as it is, but of space as we can make it—for better or worse” (26). What kinds of social or cultural consequences do you think Steyerl is alluding to when she says “for better or worse”? </h2>
                <p class="bodyText">
                    When Steyerl alludes to the power of aerial imagery and 3D-generated environments to be used "for better or worse", I think she is referring to the benefits and costs that have come along with the rise of any new technology. Going back to the Industrial Revolution, technological advances had significant benefits to society like the ability to mass manufacture goods, while also creating many problems like pollution and child labour. In the case of new technology that allows for aerial imagery and 3D-generated environments, the benefits include gains in efficiency (eg. GPS vs. reading a traditional paper map), connectivity and entertainment (eg. video games), and education (eg. 3D cadaver models used by surgical students). However, costs include violations of privacy and security and the spread of misinformation. For instance, the possibilities and dangers of the "metaverse" have been hotly debated in the past year or so, especially as Meta (formerly Facebook) became a leader in the development of virtual reality technology. The metaverse is a virtual world that allows users to interact with each other through 3D avatars, via the use of specialized hardware. While the idea of being able to work and interact with people around the world in a virtual environment definitely has many benefits to society, including increasing connectivity and providing a new frontier for business opportunities, there are also many risks involved like issues with privacy (eg. personal data collection from the VR headsets) and concerns around who/ what controls how these virtual spaces operate (functionally, monetarily).
