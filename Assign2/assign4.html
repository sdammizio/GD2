                        <h2>Stage 1: Selecting a Digital Interaction</h2>
                        <p class="bodyText">I decided to explore the simple digital interaction of accessing files on iCloud. It is a very interaction I make daily, multiple times a day as I complete school work. I store most of my files on the cloud because of limited storage space and memory issues on my computer and I like the ease of accessing the files across all mu devices. However, I also know there are many privacy and security issues, along with environmental impacts, from cloud storage and I thought this could be interesting to explore with my infographic.</p>

                        <p class="bodyText">Cloud computing refers to an aggregation of servers that you don’t have to know much about to gain the benefit
                            hen you use a cloud-based service, your actions and data may be split among many machines and drives—maybe even across continents.
                            Apple disclosed in its iOS Security Guide in January 2018 that it stored iCloud file data in both Amazon and Google’s commercial cloud storage systems (Amazon S3 and Google Cloud). Apple notes that it encrypts the files it stores on other services by breaking them into “chunks” and using strong encryption on each piece. It stores metadata—information that describes the files—and all the encryption keys on its own servers, while the file chunks are stored anonymously on S3 and Google Cloud (or elsewhere).</p>

                        <p class="bodyText"><b>Cloud Security</b><br></p>
                        <p class="bodyText">Cloud secures your information by encrypting it when it’s in transit and storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format. Many Apple services use end-to-end encryption, which means that only you can access your information, and only on trusted devices where you’re signed in with your Apple ID. 3rd party servers don’t have encryption keys. On each of your devices, the data that you store in iCloud and that’s associated with your Apple ID is protected with a key derived from information unique to that device, combined with your device passcode which only you know. No one else, not even Apple, can access end-to-end encrypted information.</p>

                        <p class="bodyText"><b>Concept</b><br></p>
                        <p class="bodyText">A strong aspect of my qualitative experience with iCloud is constantly having to click through layers of files to get to my desired file and feeling irritated by that process. My research got me interested in layers of transparency/ levels of protection involved in Apple’s storing iCloud data- from it leaving my computer- becoming encrypted- and then being chunked and stored in 3rd party servers worldwide. I thought it would be interesting to create an infographic that explored these layers of complexity and interaction with my data. AR is an interesting format because it allows interaction between the audience and my infographic in a virtual/physical space- like my interactions with my files on my computer.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bodyText">Data used: screenshots (qualitative), duration of interaction, how accessed the cloud (eg. password entered or not), internet source (public wifi, private wifi)</p>
                        <p class="bodyText"><b>Notes on the Prototype</b><br></p>
                        <p class="bodyText">I created the prototype in Adobe Aero, importing flat layers from Illustrator and arranging them in the 3D space of the Aero workspace. The infographic design 
                            recreates an office environment, similar to the environment in which I access the Cloud. The phone stack's top layer is a video of me clicking through my files. The vertical lines extending from the top to bottom layer represent the 5 interactions I recorded and the type of line (dashed, 		solid) represents the security of the connection in those instances (public vs private wifi).
                            The second to top layer is a static pixelated version of the top layer, as data begins travelling through digital space as it is stored. The third layer is the pixelations transformed into dots, as data continues to be transformed. Coloured dots indicate how I accessed the files (password entered, touch auto-password, no password, 2 step authentification). Size of dots indicated the duration of the interaction with the cloud on that interaction (duration of my exposure to privacy breach).
                            The bottom layer shows a rough distribution of data servers worldwide on which Apple stores iCloud data, representing the final destination for my data which may or may not be secured at this point.
